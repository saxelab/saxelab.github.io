I am investigating the computational mechanisms and neural representations underlying
continual learning in the human brain. I'm funded by a Medical Science Division Graduate Studentship and co-supervised by [Chris Summerfield](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/christopher-summerfield) and Andrew Saxe.
