How does the brain rewire itself in response to experience? 
We think that learning in the brain proceeds by changing the
connection strengths between neurons, but what are the rules that
govern this process? What kinds of representations do they produce?
And how do these representations support adaptive (and maladaptive)
generalization of previously learned relationships?
My research aims to address these questions by studying the behavior
of rodents and their patterns of neural activity as they learn to
perform complex tasks with richly structured associations.
