I earned my PhD from Imperial College London under the supervision of Claudia Clopath. During my doctoral studies and subsequent postdoctoral position, I focused on developing mechanistic models of synaptic plasticity. Seeking to further collaborate with experimental researchers, I joined Athena Akramiâ€™s lab at the SWC where we developed a cross-species research project investigating decision-making in rodents, humans, and computational models. Recently, I joined the Saxe lab to delve deeper into the intersection between experimental and theoretical neuroscience, with a particular interest in the mechanisms and fundamentals underlying learning and memory formation.
