Brains have a seemingly infinite ability to learn, remember and forget. As a proxi for learning in the brain, I study the learning rules that unlock such flexible and robust learning in neural networks models. 
I am particularly interested in the relative contributions and interplay between the various processes thought to be involved in biological learning, for instance synaptic plasticity, structural plasticity and innate connectivity motifs.
To understand how these processes may be implemented in the brain, I use tools from Physics and ML, combining top-down (e.g. analytical derivations in linear recurrent networks) and bottom-up approaches (e.g. numerical simulations/optimizations of rate or spiking recurrent networks).
